What did you like about this project?
Been quite humbling and frustrating. 14.5 hours and I can't get it to how it should look like.

What did you struggle with in this project?
Biggest hurdle is getting the flexbox in the right place. I need to pay attention to the <div>s

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Well, I think it is a real challenge at least for me to pick html and css in 3 weeks. I'm not sure if there's a way to improve the experience. I guess I'll need more time to revisit the concepts. Perhaps a list of all html/css syntax on day one so that we can focus. I feel jumping around in W3schools or one of the websites is a bit difficult to follow. Going through code academy requires us to go through even those you are not covering, so it takes quite a bit of time.
